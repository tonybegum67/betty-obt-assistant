48,domain_expertise,Global PD,What is the difference between maturity levels and impact scores?,Maturity: 1-5 scale (Initial to Optimized); Impact: 0-3 integers (project impact),"**Maturity Levels (1-5 Scale):**
Current state assessment of organizational capability development
- Level 1: Initial (ad hoc, unpredictable)
- Level 2: Managed (basic processes exist)
- Level 3: Defined (standardized processes)
- Level 4: Quantitatively Managed (data-driven control)
- Level 5: Optimized (continuous improvement)

**Impact Scores (0-3 Scale):**
Project value assessment for portfolio prioritization
- 0: No impact
- 1: Low impact
- 2: Medium impact  
- 3: High impact

**Key Differences:**
- **Purpose**: Maturity measures ""how good are we now"" vs Impact measures ""how valuable is this project""
- **Timeline**: Maturity is current state vs Impact is future potential value
- **Usage**: Maturity identifies capability gaps vs Impact prioritizes investments
- **Data Sources**: Maturity from capability definition XLSX files vs Impact from project impact XLSX files

**Critical Distinction:**
Never confuse a Level 3 maturity (Defined processes) with a 3-impact score (High value project). They measure completely different dimensions of organizational capability and project value.
