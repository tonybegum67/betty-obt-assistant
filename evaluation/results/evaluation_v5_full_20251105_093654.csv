1. **Advanced Analytics** (Foundational enabler)
   - Impact Score: 3 across multiple Data & AI capabilities
   - Enables: Decision speed, data-driven insights, cross-domain optimization
   - Current Maturity: Level 2 → Target: Level 4

2. **Digital Twin** (Strategic differentiator)
   - Impact Score: 3 for operational efficiency and product development
   - Enables: Real-time optimization, predictive modeling, design validation
   - Current Maturity: Level 2 → Target: Level 4

3. **Predictive Maintenance** (Operational optimizer)
   - Impact Score: 2-3 for manufacturing efficiency
   - Enables: Downtime reduction, cost optimization, quality consistency
   - Current Maturity: Level 1 → Target: Level 3

**Rationale:** Advanced Analytics provides foundational data capabilities that amplify Digital Twin and Predictive Maintenance effectiveness. Digital Twin offers highest strategic value for product innovation. Predictive Maintenance delivers immediate operational ROI but depends on analytics maturity.

**Recommended Sequence:** Analytics foundation → Digital Twin implementation → Predictive Maintenance optimization

**Priority Actions:**

• **Establish Digital Twin Governance Structure** - Form cross-functional team with Engineering, Manufacturing, and IT to define standards, data ownership, and integration protocols

• **Implement Real-Time Data Integration** - Deploy automated sensor data collection for top 3 product families to enable live performance monitoring and predictive maintenance capabilities  

• **Develop Standardized Simulation Models** - Create validated digital replicas for priority products using existing CAD/PLM data as foundation for physics-based modeling

**Rationale:** Digital Twin scores highest impact (3) in Data and AI Project Impacts for operational efficiency and predictive capabilities. Current Level 2 indicates basic modeling exists but lacks real-time integration and standardization needed for quantitative decision-making.

Current Maturity: Level 2 (Managed)
Target Maturity: Level 4 (Quantitatively Managed)

**Current State Context:**
Basic change control processes exist with defined approval workflows, but lack standardization across product lines. ECO processes are documented but not consistently measured or optimized.

**Target State Context:**
Quantitative management enables data-driven change decisions with statistical process control, predictive change impact analysis, and automated workflow optimization.

**Key Gap:**
Moving from reactive change management to predictive, data-driven change control with measurable performance outcomes.

Maturity = ""How developed is this capability now?""
Impact = ""How much strategic value will this project deliver?""

Maturity informs current state assessment. Impact scores drive portfolio prioritization and investment decisions.
