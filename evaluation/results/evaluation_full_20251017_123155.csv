- Integration with existing PLM/CAD systems

**2. Data & AI Director**
- Data strategy and governance for Digital Twin
- AI/ML model development and training
- Analytics and insights generation

- Infrastructure: 6 percentage points above target (21% vs 15%)

**Strategic Implication:**
With Capabilities representing only 13% of current allocation versus a 55% target, this suggests the portfolio is heavily skewed toward addressing immediate pain points and infrastructure needs while underinvesting in core capability development that drives long-term competitive advantage.

**Recommendation:**
Rebalance portfolio allocation to increase Capabilities investment by ~42 percentage points, likely shifting some Infrastructure allocation (currently over-weighted) and maintaining current Pain focus.

3. **Business-Focused:** *""Product launch timelines meet committed dates through improved design data management and reduced engineering change cycles.""*

**Why This Reframe Matters:**
The original statement focuses on the solution (PLM deployment). The outcome focuses on the end state - what teams will be able to do differently and what value they'll experience. This keeps the focus on results rather than technology implementation.

- ""Production delivers consistent customer commitments""
- ""Manufacturing operations enable predictable delivery""

**Executive Sponsors**
- Approve platform scope and resource allocation
- Remove organizational barriers to adoption
- Champion data-driven culture transformation

**Data & AI Team**
- Platform architecture and technical delivery
- Data governance framework implementation
- User training and support infrastructure

**IT Infrastructure**
- Platform hosting and security compliance
- Integration with existing systems
- Performance monitoring and maintenance

## Critical Alignment Points

1. **Success Metrics:** Platform adoption rate, decision speed improvement, data quality scores
2. **Timeline Dependency:** Requires data governance foundation (Q1) before advanced analytics (Q2)
3. **Resource Commitment:** Each domain commits 20% FTE for initial 6 months
4. **Risk Mitigation:** Phased rollout by domain to manage change impact

- The stakeholder perspective (customers, engineers, business)
- The underlying value proposition

**Better OBT outcome statements:**

**WHAT-focused:**
- ""Engineering teams consistently deliver products that meet market windows""
- ""Product launches align with customer demand cycles""
- ""Development cycles match competitive market pressures""

**Then the HOW becomes:**
- HOW measured: Time-to-market reduction of 20%
- HOW achieved: Improved design workflows, faster approvals, etc.

**""Customers always choose Molex first.""**

This represents the ultimate strategic outcome that all 288 outcomes across the 13 strategic clusters are designed to achieve. The GPS (Global Positioning System) framework uses this destination as the North Star for all strategic transformation initiatives.

The GPS framework organizes strategic outcomes in a cluster-based navigation system with variable depth (1-6 tiers) based on strategic complexity, but all paths lead to this single, clear destination: ensuring Molex becomes the preferred choice for customers in every interaction and decision.

48,domain_expertise,Global PD,What is the difference between maturity levels and impact scores?,Maturity: 1-5 scale (Initial to Optimized); Impact: 0-3 integers (project impact),"## Maturity Levels vs Impact Scores - Critical Distinction

**Maturity Levels (1-5 Scale)**
- **Purpose**: Assess current capability sophistication
- **Scale**: 1 (Initial) → 2 (Managed) → 3 (Defined) → 4 (Quantitatively Managed) → 5 (Optimized)
- **Source**: Domain-specific XLSX capability matrices
- **Use**: Gap analysis, capability roadmaps, organizational development
- **Example**: ""Requirements Management current maturity: Level 2 (Managed)""

**Impact Scores (0-3 Scale)**
- **Purpose**: Measure project/initiative strategic value
- **Scale**: 0 (No Impact) → 1 (Low) → 2 (Medium) → 3 (High)
- **Source**: Project impact XLSX files by domain
- **Use**: Portfolio prioritization, resource allocation, ROI analysis
- **Scoring**: Only scores of 2 and 3 count toward strategic totals

**Critical Data Rule**
NEVER confuse these scales. They measure completely different dimensions:
- Maturity = ""How sophisticated is our current capability?""
- Impact = ""How strategically valuable is this project/outcome?""

**Example Correct Usage:**
- ""Change Control Management operates at maturity Level 3 (Defined)""
- ""Project XYZ has an impact score of 3 (High strategic value)""

**Data Confidence**: HIGH (>90%) - Based on structured XLSX matrices across 5+ domains
