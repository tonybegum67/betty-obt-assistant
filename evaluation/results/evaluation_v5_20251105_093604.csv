**PRIORITY RANKING:**

1. **Digital Twin** (Impact Score: 3)
   - Highest strategic value for real-time product performance optimization
   - Enables comprehensive simulation and testing capabilities

2. **Advanced Analytics** (Impact Score: 3) 
   - Tied highest impact, critical for data-driven decision making
   - Foundation for predictive capabilities across operations

3. **Predictive Maintenance** (Impact Score: 2)
   - Lower strategic impact but important operational efficiency
   - Dependent on Digital Twin and Advanced Analytics maturity

**RATIONALE:**
Digital Twin and Advanced Analytics both score maximum impact (3) but Digital Twin provides broader transformation potential across product development lifecycle. Predictive Maintenance, while valuable, serves more targeted operational needs.

**RECOMMENDED SEQUENCING:**
Phase 1: Advanced Analytics (foundation)
Phase 2: Digital Twin (comprehensive capability)  
Phase 3: Predictive Maintenance (specialized application)
