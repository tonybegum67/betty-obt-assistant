48,domain_expertise,Global PD,What is the difference between maturity levels and impact scores?,Maturity: 1-5 scale (Initial to Optimized); Impact: 0-3 integers (project impact),"**Maturity Levels (1-5 Scale):**
- Measures current capability development stage
- Scale: 1=Initial, 2=Managed, 3=Defined, 4=Quantitatively Managed, 5=Optimized
- Found in: Domain-specific capability matrices (XLSX files)
- Purpose: Assesses ""how developed"" a capability is today

**Impact Scores (0-3 Scale):**
- Measures project's strategic value/business impact
- Scale: 0=No impact, 1=Low, 2=Medium, 3=High impact
- Found in: Project impact analysis files (XLSX)
- Purpose: Prioritizes ""how valuable"" projects are for investment

**Critical Distinction:**
- Maturity = Current state assessment of capabilities
- Impact = Future value assessment of projects
- Different data sources, different scales, different purposes
- High-maturity capabilities can still have high-impact improvement projects
- Low-maturity areas often generate multiple high-impact projects

**Example:**
Requirements Management might be Maturity Level 2 (Managed) while having 5 projects scoring Impact 3 (High) because significant improvement opportunity exists.
