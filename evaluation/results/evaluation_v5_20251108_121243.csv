**Priority Ranking by Impact Score:**

1. **Digital Twin** - Impact Score: 3 (High)
   - Drives operational efficiency and real-time decision making
   - Enables predictive capabilities across product lifecycle

2. **Advanced Analytics** - Impact Score: 3 (High) 
   - Provides foundation for data-driven insights
   - Supports strategic decision making capabilities

3. **Predictive Maintenance** - Impact Score: 2 (Medium)
   - Improves operational reliability
   - Lower strategic impact than twin/analytics capabilities

**Recommendation:** Prioritize Digital Twin first for maximum operational transformation, followed by Advanced Analytics to establish analytical foundation, then Predictive Maintenance for operational optimization.
