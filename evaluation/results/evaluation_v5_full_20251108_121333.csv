Based on Data and AI Project Impacts (100225).xlsx:

**1. Digital Twin (Priority 1)**
- Impact Score: 3 (Highest)
- Current Maturity: Level 2, Target: Level 4
- Strategic Value: Enables real-time product optimization and predictive insights

**2. Advanced Analytics (Priority 2)**
- Impact Score: 2-3 (High-Highest)
- Current Maturity: Level 2, Target: Level 4
- Strategic Value: Foundation for data-driven decision making across operations

**3. Predictive Maintenance (Priority 3)**
- Impact Score: 2 (High)
- Current Maturity: Level 1, Target: Level 3
- Strategic Value: Operational efficiency and cost reduction

**Rationale:** Digital Twin scores maximum impact (3) and has established foundation (Level 2). Advanced Analytics provides broad organizational benefit. Predictive Maintenance, while valuable, has lowest current maturity requiring more foundational work.

**Recommended Sequence:** Advance Digital Twin to Level 3, strengthen Advanced Analytics foundation, then accelerate Predictive Maintenance capabilities.

**Current State Analysis:**
Level 2 indicates basic change control processes exist with some documentation and repeatability, but lack standardization across the organization. Change requests follow defined workflows but may have inconsistent execution.

**Target State Vision:**
Level 4 represents quantitatively managed change control with metrics-driven decision making, predictable cycle times, and data-based process optimization. Statistical process control enables proactive management of change performance.

**Key Gap Areas:**
- Standardized change metrics and KPIs across all product lines
- Automated change impact analysis and risk assessment
- Quantitative process control for change cycle time optimization
- Advanced analytics for change pattern prediction and bottleneck identification

- Impact scores drive project portfolio decisions
- Never substitute one scale for the other in analysis

- Impact scores (2s and 3s) determine project funding allocation
