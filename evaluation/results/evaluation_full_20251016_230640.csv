1. BETTER: ""Customers actively provide actionable feedback that drives improvements""
2. EVEN BETTER: ""Customer insights consistently drive product and service improvements""

The second version is preferred because it:
- Focuses on WHAT we want to achieve (insights driving improvements)
- Is solution-agnostic (doesn't prescribe surveys as the method)
- Shows clear business value (improvements)
- Uses present tense, active voice
- Avoids prescribing HOW (surveys) to achieve the outcome

The original statement would be better positioned as a HOW that supports broader customer insight and improvement outcomes.

26,classification,OBT Methodology,Classify 'Decision support improves' — What or How?,What — but needs specificity. Better: Decisions are data-informed consistently,"Let me classify this outcome statement using OBT principles:

""Decision support improves"" is a HOW statement

Reasoning:
1. It describes an action/method (improving support mechanisms)
2. It's a means rather than an end result
3. It doesn't directly state the business value/outcome
4. It focuses on the mechanism (support system) rather than the result

To convert to a WHAT statement, consider:
""Better decisions drive business results"" or 
""Decisions consistently achieve intended outcomes""

These WHAT versions focus on the actual business outcome rather than the support mechanism.

RISK LEVEL: LOW IMPACT
Source: Data and AI Project Impacts (100225).xlsx

Key Risk Factors:

1. Technical Implementation (Low Risk)
- Limited scope affects only non-critical data systems
- No direct impact on product development core workflows
- Isolated from primary ECO and BOM management systems

2. Process Integration (Low Risk)
- Current maturity level suitable for pilot implementation (Level 2 - Managed)
- Minimal disruption to existing data governance frameworks
- Limited stakeholder involvement required

3. Resource Requirements (Low Risk)
- Small team deployment sufficient
- Standard IT infrastructure adequate
- Minimal specialized training needed

Mitigation Recommendations:
1. Start with proof-of-concept in non-critical data area
2. Document integration points with existing systems
3. Establish basic monitoring metrics

Next Steps:
1. Define specific use case boundaries
2. Identify pilot team members
3. Create basic validation criteria

1. States the desired end state (optimized lines achieving targets)
2. Is measurable (can track throughput rates vs targets)
3. Avoids prescribing how (doesn't specify particular optimization methods)
4. Creates accountability (production teams can own this outcome)

This aligns with the Manufacturing cluster in the GPS framework. You could further enhance by specifying:
- The target throughput rate
- The consistency measure (e.g., ""95% of the time"")
- The scope (specific lines or facilities)

""Optimized production lines consistently achieve 500 units/hour throughput rates 95% of operating time""

- Prescriptive method (""automation"")
- Input/activity-based thinking

BETTER OUTCOME STATEMENTS (What):

5. Allows multiple solution paths

Remember: Outcomes describe the desired end state (What), not the method to achieve it (How). Robots might be one solution path, but there could be others like software automation, process redesign, or alternative technologies.
